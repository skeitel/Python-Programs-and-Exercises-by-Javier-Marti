Extracting maximum business value through data extraction automation.
Instead of being simple theoretical exercises, the programs displayed here have a variety of practical applications. Examples are:

- python_brainstorming_permutator is useful to mix any number of elements with all the possible combinations of other elements. This is useful for brainstorming, but also to combine numbers in the logistics, accounting, legal or patenting areas

- master_job_alerts and similar programs use code that can be applied in a variety of parsing and scrapping needs and websites, in order to automate info gathering and personalisation and posting of tailor-made messages. This is useful for social media marketing, finance, content creation, competitive analysis, etc...

- reddit_trendspotter is useful for the early detecion of trends. This information can be applied to new product creation, marketing campaign targeting, investment decisions, etc...Such a program answers the question "what is trending right now..." and opens the door to further exploration of said trends.
