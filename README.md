# Python Programs and Exercises by Javier Marti
Extracting maximum business value through data extraction automation.
Instead of being simple theoretical exercises, my programs displayed here have a variety of practical and profitable applications, saving time and money to organizations or simplifying information gathering and sharing of valuable information. 
Some examples are:

- google_search_open_tabs.py is useful to automate and speed up the process of Google searching many different search terms. The program searches for any number of search terms (plus extra additional words)and scrapes for emails the
first X number of results or several result pages. Once this is done the program uses Selenium and Regex to extract the email address of that company, previously verifying that the email has not already been added to the database. 

- master_job_alerts.py, linkeding_bot, dating_website_auto... are useful to in a variety of parsing and scrapping needs and websites, in order to automate info gathering and personalisation and posting of tailor-made messages without user input or monitoring. Uses: social media marketing, finance, content creation, competitive analysis, etc...

- reddit_trendspotter.py is useful for the early detecion of trends. This information can be applied to new product creation, marketing campaign targeting, investment decisions, etc...Such a program answers the question "what is trending right now..." and opens the door to further exploration of said trends.

- word_report_creator.py is useful to generate automated reports that can be sent via email to specific people or other departments in an organization. The program takes information from different webpages in real time to create from scratch a report including  information from each of those website in one report in Word format

- python_brainstorming_permutator.py mixes any number of elements with all the possible combinations of many other elements. This is useful for brainstorming, but also to combine numbers in the logistics, accounting, legal or patenting areas

- email_notification_sender.py facilitates is useful to avoid delays in the onboarding of a new person to a company by streamlining the communication process between departments. The program checks that someone has been added to an excel sheet and automatically notifies via email another person of this addition to the document. For example, the CTO approves the recruitment of a new person, adds it to the excel database and this is automatically sent to the personnel department in order to prepare the onboarding process in an orderly and timely fashion
